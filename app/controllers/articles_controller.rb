class ArticlesController < ApplicationController

=begin   
  When an action does not explicitly render a view (or otherwise trigger an HTTP response), 
  Rails will automatically render a view that matches the name of the controller and action (make sure its created). 
  Convention Over Configuration! Views are located in the app/views directory. So the index action will render app/views/articles/index.html.erb by default.

    # and then you permit the individual attributes inside that hash to be used.
